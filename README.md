# Raspberry Turk

The Raspberry Turk is a robot that can play chess—it's entirely open source, based on Raspberry Pi, and inspired by the 18th century chess playing machine, the Mechanical Turk. The project incorporates aspects of computer vision, data science, machine learning, robotics, 3D printing, and—of course—chess.
